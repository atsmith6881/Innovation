/*
The first tutorial "Building Layouts: Part 1" was an introductory tutorial to the basics of java for an android app.
They introduce vocabulary like Camel Case, User Interface, and layout. As the tutorial progresses it introduces more vocabulary,
and what they mean. For example, XML stands for "Extensible Markup Language," and is the notation for writing information in the
form of a hieracrchy. In the XML syntax there is XML elements, tags, self-closing tags, attributes, and syntax. The tutorial
also says how it's okay to not memorize everything and look up information that is unknown. The video for text-view talks about
Android studio, and the different resolutions, medium, high, and extra-high, and how they're density-independent pixels (better
screens will have more pixels). This trails into text-size, text-color, and imageView. It finishes with documentation, which
helps explain the purpose of the app, the user instructions, or where the app is capable of running.

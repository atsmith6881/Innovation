/*
The first tutorial "Making an App Interactive: Part 1" gets more in-depth with building the android application. It helps you start to build the layout for the app, and gets into using variables. The tutorial talks about crashes including compile time errors, runtime errors, and a stacktrace. It starts to get out of basics by applying data types and variables to increment and decrement. The methods are starting to mean more.

The second tutorial "Making an App Interactive: Part 2" is also a review for the syntax. Nested ViewGroups bring things full circle with a hierarchy of Linear Layout on top; from there it goes to relative layout, textview; finally, it trails to imageview and textview again. It gives an introduction to Strings and gets more in-depth with how to compare them, and going between and int and String.

The third tutorial "Practice Set: Making an App Interactive" is another review while talking about declaring and initializing variables. The quiz talks about the correct syntax for referring to variables, for example this one regards an int for a calculator. This tutorial is more of quizzes than anything else, which just tests knowledge.
